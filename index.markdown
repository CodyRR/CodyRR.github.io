Welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find my projects and my skills.

I am a Software Developer. I have worked with computers for over a decade. I am able to make simple and complex programs.
My known languages are Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and React.
In my early career, I was a Pharmacy Technician. Which is where I learned technical skills, critical thinking, and can develope a consistent workflow of tasks.

I want to use those skills to assist me in my career in Technology.
